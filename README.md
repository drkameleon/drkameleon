![Hello world](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drkameleon/drkameleon/main/splash.png)

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the [Arturo Programming Language](https://github.com/arturo-lang/arturo), [Grafito Database](https://github.com/arturo-lang/grafito) and many more little (or not so little) projects
- 🌱 I’m learning more about Programming Language Development (Bytecode-based VMs included), Graph Databases and Informational Linguistics
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 I’m always open for ideas/feedback (code contributions are 100% welcome too!)
- 🤗 I'm looking for sponsors so that I can focus on what really matters (without worrying - too much - about the 💸 monthly bills )
